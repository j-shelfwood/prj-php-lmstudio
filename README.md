# LMStudio PHP

A PHP package for integrating with LMStudio's local API. This library allows you to interact with LMStudio via both OpenAIâ€‘compatible endpoints (/v1) and the new LM Studio REST API endpoints (/api/v0). It supports chat and text completions, embeddings, tool calls (including streaming responses), and is designed with dependency injection in mind.
